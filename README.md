# js-neverflight

A simple quadcopter PID loop demo and simulation. Step through the PID loop or let it run in an animation. Request the 
quad move to an angle and tune the PID controller for the best response.

A nice tune is P = 100, I = 25, D = 130, snappy with little bounce back.

Also includes a wind simulation (sort of)

A Work In Progress!!
